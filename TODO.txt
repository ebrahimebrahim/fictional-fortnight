add more smoke dissipation frames to player missile explosion, to make use of the fadout.

maybe things SHOULD be able to move more than just UDLR?
then some monsters could try to aim for player
maybe player could use mouse to aim
idk... maybe i should keep this project simple.

player speed boost button? could be fun
  still need to show feedback etc. maybe only remain active while shift is held?

make some more monsters. ideas:
  an octopus that shoots ink which splats. the ink is wide but very slow
  a fungus that shoots spores that explode into a cloud. the spores are very small but the cloud is huge and deadly
  an electric orb thing that shoots electricity bolts. they are fast and long and disappear quickly. infrequent shots.


move score window to bottom and put useful info like
  ave fps rather than fps
  missile and boost ready status
  a bar showing how close score is to game win state

optimize vector calculations in various entity update steps

player pickup -- alternative missile

a main menu, a how to play, a win screen, a lose screen
