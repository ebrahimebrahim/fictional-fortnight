Now is the time to learn how to MOVE something. How do we move a textbox to the status indicator?

player speed boost button? could be fun
  still need to show feedback etc. maybe only remain active while shift is held?

Gem monster death animation should have it breaking apart into four pieces

make some more monsters. ideas:
  an octopus that shoots ink which splats. the ink is wide but very slow
  a fungus that shoots spores that explode into a cloud. the spores are very small but the cloud is huge and deadly
  an electric orb thing that shoots electricity bolts. they are fast and long and disappear quickly. infrequent shots.

move score window to bottom and put useful info like
  ave fps rather than fps
  missile and boost ready status
  a bar showing how close score is to game win state

optimize vector calculations in various entity update steps

player pickup -- alternative missile

a main menu, a how to play, a win screen, a lose screen


--- General notes and things I've learned from this ---

Error logging should be handled in a better way perhaps by catching and throwing exceptions.
It was kind go a pain to pass the logger object around between methods.

Planning out "architecture" before writing classes is pretty important. Exactly who is responsible for what?
