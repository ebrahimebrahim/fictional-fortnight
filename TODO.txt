make some more monsters. ideas:
  an electric orb thing that shoots electricity bolts. they are fast and long and disappear quickly. infrequent shots. small target

a main menu, a how to play, a win screen, a lose screen

player pickup -- alternative missile. maybe the player can get all the different monster missiles somehow?
perhaps by killing a different version of a monster, like a big boss version with hp

the rate at which monsters spawn can perhaps be more regular.
maybe periodic with random noise added to the periodicity, rather than "poisson dist" style spawning.
the rate could perhaps scale up with score, making players push harder towards the end and giving them a break if they
lost all their score.
also: when monsters spawn 1 by 1 it's easy to snipe them out before they even start shooting.
they have to come in waves for there to be any challenge

add sounds?


--- General notes and things I've learned from this ---

Error logging should be handled in a better way perhaps by catching and throwing exceptions.
It was kind go a pain to pass the logger object around between methods.

Planning out "architecture" before writing classes is pretty important. Exactly who is responsible for what?

UI gets complicated when you build it from scratch, and it's worth thinking about a general way to handle things
