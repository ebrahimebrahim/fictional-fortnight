set up circular buffer in utilities

use circular buffer for controlling keyboard input:
  on keypress push key onto the buffer
  on update look from the currently pressed arrow keys which is the most recent
  use that one to decide next try method to call.

set up precise positioning for projectile spawn point
have projectiles die at edge of screen (part of projectile list update, die flag is turned on. also in update the thing is erased from list when the time comes)

rename Entity to EntityGroup b/c that seems to be what it really is.
