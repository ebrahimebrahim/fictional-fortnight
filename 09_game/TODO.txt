put sprites+explosion filename into projectilelist constructor or loadmedia etc. , so that you can make other ones for the monsters

rename Entity to EntityGroup b/c that seems to be what it really is.

maybe think of a way to systematize collision detection at the app level.
maybe each entity can report hitbox info to one collision detection module which, at each update, calculates collision info
then entities can in turn use that collision info
hmmm...

create one monster type, then abstract it to a base class with virtual functions

optimize vector calculations in various entity update steps
